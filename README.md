# This is the read me file, it contains basic information about the web app and how to operate it.
Note: There is a TODOs file that displays a TODO list of tasks to be completed.

## Database (This section describes the process on setting up the database for the web app)
    1. Head over to phpMyAdmin and create a new database named "system".
    2. Open the "sql_table_gen.sql" file and copy and paste it into the system database's SQL section and run it.
    3. Multiple tables should be generated and you can now do the next steps to setup the database.
    4. Now open the "sample_insert_data.sql" file and copy and paste it into the system database's SQL section.
    5. Before running this script, make sure you disable foreign key checks to ensure that this script runs successfully.
    6. The database should now be populated with some sample dummy datas.
    7. The database setup is now completed and you are free to modify the sql scripts for your needs.
